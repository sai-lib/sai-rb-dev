A powerful color science toolkit for seamless cross-model manipulation.

Sai is a sophisticated color management system built on precise color science principles. It provides a unified 
interface across multiple color models (RGB, HSL, CMYK, CIE Lab, Oklab, and more), allowing operations in any model to 
intelligently propagate throughout the entire color ecosystem.

Key features include cross-model operations, perceptually accurate color comparisons using multiple Delta-E algorithms,
accessibility tools for contrast evaluation, sophisticated color matching, and scientific color analysis with CIE
standards support.

Sai empowers developers to work with colors consistently across different environments and applications. Whether
developing design tools, data visualizations, or accessibility-focused applications, Sai provides both mathematical
precision and an intuitive API for sophisticated color manipulation.
