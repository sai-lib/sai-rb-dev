# A powerful color science toolkit for seamless cross-space manipulation.
#
# Sai is a sophisticated color management system built on precise color science principles. It provides a unified
# interface across multiple color spaces (RGB, HSL, CMYK, CIE Lab, Oklab, and more), allowing operations in any space to
# intelligently propagate throughout the entire color ecosystem.
#
# Key features include cross-space operations, perceptually accurate color comparisons using multiple Delta-E
# algorithms, accessibility tools for contrast evaluation, sophisticated color matching, and scientific color analysis
# with CIE standards support.
#
# Sai empowers developers to work with colors consistently across different environments and applications. Whether
# developing design tools, data visualizations, or accessibility-focused applications, Sai provides both mathematical
# precision and an intuitive API for sophisticated color manipulation.
