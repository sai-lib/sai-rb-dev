# ADR 006: Performance Considerations

## Status

## Context

Color operations, particularly color space transformations, can be computationally intensive. As the Sai color library
grows, we need clear performance guidelines to ensure the library is both efficient and maintainable. Without
established principles, we risk either under-optimizing (creating a slow library) or over-optimizing
(making the code unnecessarily complex).

Certain color transformations, particularly those involving XYZ and Lab color spaces, are mathematically complex and can
become performance bottlenecks when used frequently or in batch processing scenarios.

## Decision

We will adopt the following performance guidelines:

### Performance Expectations

* **Core Operations**: Simple arithmetic operations (e.g., channel access, simple blending) should be near-instantaneous
  (<1ms)
* **Basic Transformations**: Common transformations (RGB to HSL/HSV) should be fast (<5ms)
* **Complex Transformations**: More complex transformations (to XYZ, Lab) may take longer but should still be optimized
* **Batch Operations**: Provide optimized methods for batch processing when transforming multiple colors simultaneously

### Lazy vs. Eager Computation

* **Default Approach**: Use lazy computation for expensive operations
* **Exceptions**: Pre-compute values that are frequently accessed or needed for rendering
* **Method Design**: Methods should compute results only when called, rather than pre-computing all possible
  transformations
* **Code Loading**: Follow a strict lazy loading approach where code is only loaded into memory when needed
  (e.g., HSL model code only loads when an HSL conversion is requested)

### Memory Usage Guidelines

* **Priority**: Favor memory usage over computation time when the trade-off is reasonable
* **Object Size**: Keep color objects as lightweight as possible while maintaining functionality
* **Temporary Objects**: Minimize creation of temporary objects in hot paths
* **Memory Limits**: Allow configuration of cache sizes to adapt to different memory constraints

### Benchmarking and Testing

* **Benchmark Suite**: Maintain a benchmark suite that tests performance of critical operations
* **Performance Tests**: Include performance tests that fail if operations exceed expected times
* **Regression Testing**: Run benchmarks on significant changes to ensure performance doesn't degrade
* **Real-world Scenarios**: Include benchmarks that simulate real-world use patterns

### Code Clarity vs. Optimization

* **Readability First**: Prefer readable code over micro-optimizations
* **Critical Paths**: Identify and optimize only the most performance-critical paths
* **Documentation**: Document performance characteristics and any non-obvious optimizations
* **Algorithms**: Prefer mathematically efficient algorithms even if they're slightly more complex

## Alternatives Considered

### No Caching Strategy

* Considered simpler implementation with no caching
* Rejected due to repeated calculations of expensive transformations significantly impacting performance

### Pre-computing All Transformations

* Considered computing all possible transformations when a color is created
* Rejected due to excessive memory usage and unnecessary calculations for transformations that may never be used
* Contradicts the lazy computation principle

### Thread Safety vs. Performance

* Considered making thread safety optional for performance-critical applications
* Decided to maintain thread safety as a default with the option to bypass in controlled scenarios

## Consequences

### Positive

* Improved performance for repeated color operations
* Clear guidelines for performance optimization
* Balanced approach that considers both speed and memory usage
* Configurable caching that adapts to different use cases
* Maintainable code with optimizations focused on critical paths
* Reduced memory footprint for applications that only use a subset of color models
* Faster application startup times due to lazy loading of code

### Negative

* Increased complexity due to caching mechanisms
* Additional memory usage for caching
* Potential thread-safety considerations when manipulating shared caches
* Need for more thorough testing to ensure cache invalidation works correctly
* Additional complexity in maintaining proper autoloading dependencies
* Potential for first-time operation slowness when code needs to be loaded

## Implementation Notes

* Implement the core caching infrastructure first, focusing on the most computationally expensive operations
* Create benchmarks for common operations to establish baselines
* Document performance characteristics in public API
* Design the module structure to support granular code loading
* Review memory usage patterns periodically to identify potential improvements
