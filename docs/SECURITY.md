# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to our attention right away!

### Reporting Process

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue. Instead, report security vulnerabilities through
[GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature](https://github.com/rei-kei/sai/security/advisories/new).

Your report should include:

* Description of the vulnerability
* Steps to reproduce the issue
* Potential impact of the vulnerability
* Suggested fix (if any)

### What to Expect

After you've submitted your report:

1. You'll receive an acknowledgment within 24 hours
2. We'll investigate and keep you updated on our findings
3. Once we've determined the impact and resolution:
  * We'll patch the vulnerability
  * We'll make an announcement to the community if warranted
  * You'll be credited for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

### Disclosure Policy

When we receive a security bug report, we will:

1. Confirm the problem and determine affected versions
2. Audit code to find any similar problems
3. Prepare fixes for all supported versions
4. Release patches as soon as possible

### Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved, please submit a pull request.
